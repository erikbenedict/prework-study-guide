        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>Parent elements are what contain child elements.</li>

          <li> <>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>

          <ul>

            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

            <li>The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page.</li>

            <li>In CSS we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the categories of block boxes and inline boxes. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page.</li>

            <li>when we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. ex: link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"

            <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>

          </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

          <li>git checkout main: switches to the main branch</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: pulls down the latest main branch (always a good habbit to pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code)</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and swithces to it</li>

          <li>git add -A: adds, or "commits", the changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git</li>

          <li>git commit -m "description of changes made": commits, and associates a message with our commit (ie. "added code to HTML file")</li>

          <li>git push origin name-of-branch: pushes all changes made to GitHub</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow dictates that JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order matters.</li>
          <li>Use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all (if / else if).</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. EX: <br>
            for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {// code block}</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. You must call a function by name in order to execute it. A function's name is followed by parentheses (), then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
